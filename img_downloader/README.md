### Image Downloader From Wallbase

The first version of this script was written a year ago. I found it recently and as a small challenge started to refactor it.

It requires more time to bring it to an even better form but the current version is good enough for learning purposes.

## Small description

After small refactoring (change you can see [here](https://github.com/noku/scripts/commit/9d17a95e6500a619f854d2e89347d12aa7c99215?diff=split) ), the whole file got a little bigger ( 69 > 121), the main reason being creation of two additional classes and also *extract method* practice.
